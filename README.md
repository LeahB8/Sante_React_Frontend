A health and wellness app with a range of features targeted at a user's personalised health and wellbeing. 



<h2>About</h2>
A paired student project with a focus on using React as a front end technology and Rails to create a back end API. A user can edit and save their personal information such as height, weight, age, health and dietary concerns, which will produce nutrition advice based on that particular concern. A user can create and delete health and wellness goals, as well as listen to calming meditation music while setting a meditation timer to track how long they would like to meditate for.

<h2>Key learnings</h2>
<ul>
<li>React for the front end</li>
<li>Ruby on Rails for the back end</li>
<li>A public nutrition API was used to get personalised nutrition suggestions</li>

<li>CSS and Material UI used for styling</li>
</ul>
